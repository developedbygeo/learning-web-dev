          <h3>What is League of Legends?</h3>
          <p>
            League of Legends is a team-based strategy game where two teams of five powerful champions face
            off to destroy the otherâ€™s base. Choose from over 140 champions to make epic plays, secure kills,
            and take down towers as you battle your way to victory.

          <p>
            To win in LoL you must destroy the enemy Nexus. The Nexus is the core building of the enemy base
            and is the ultimate objective of the game. The first team to destroy the enemy Nexus wins the
            game.
